# MTP-Distributed-Attack-Investigation
This repository contains files and information related to my Master's Thesis Project under Prof. Sandip Chakraborty, as part of my Dual Degree in CSE at IIT Kharagpur.

Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks, characterized by their persistence and sophistication, pose significant threats to organizations. This project explores the challenges of investigating APT attacks in distributed systems and proposes a tailored attack investigation system. This research aims to empower organizations to strengthen their security defences and respond to incidents more effectively.
